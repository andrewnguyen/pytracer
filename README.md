pytracer
========

Andrew Nguyen

ASCII raytracer in python. Purposefully avoided OOP. Why? Just to see how far I could get. So far only supports spheres.

### How to run:

python3 pytracer

### Notes

Ran screenshot using courier 9pt font full screen with a 13" macbook air.
Adjust the film.py file to taste.

### Look! A screenshot!
